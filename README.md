# Risk Analysis of Healthcare Access and Racial Disparities in Preventable Hospitalizations

**Summer 2025 Capstone Project**  
UnitedHealth Group Bridges to Healthcare Technology Program @ Carnegie Mellon University  
**Author:** Arturo Espana  

## Overview

This project investigates whether healthcare access â€” such as primary care physician availability and insurance coverage â€” influences racial disparities in preventable hospital stays across U.S. counties.

We modeled preventable hospitalization rates by race using:
- **Random Forests** (for variable importance)
- **Negative Binomial Regression** (for interpretable effect estimates)

Deliverables include a research poster, a technical HTML report, and fully reproducible code.

## Key Insights

- POC-majority counties face significantly higher preventable hospitalization rates than White-majority counties.
- Access to primary care and insurance coverage are among the most influential predictors.
- Random Forests revealed key non-linear interactions; regression confirmed consistent risk effects.
