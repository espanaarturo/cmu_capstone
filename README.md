## Overview

This project investigates how access to healthcare and structural determinants shape **racial disparities in preventable hospitalizations** across U.S. counties.

I developed a race-stratified modeling framework using:

- **Random Forests** to identify the most important predictors without assuming linearity
- **Negative Binomial Regression** for interpretable effect sizes and incidence rate ratios (IRRs)

My findings show that structural inequalities especially in socioeconomic conditions play a larger role in preventable hospitalizations among POC populations than clinical access alone. The results call for race-conscious interventions that address both medical and social determinants of health.

## Key Findings

- **High school completion**, **unemployment**, and **income inequality** ranked as top predictors of preventable hospitalizations for POC populations.
- **Rurality** and **provider supply** correlated paradoxically with hospitalization rates, suggesting overuse or systemic inefficiencies.
- Interventions focused solely on expanding health infrastructure may help White counties but are insufficient for POC communities unless upstream barriers are addressed.

## Methods

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Examined variable distributions and racial disparities in preventable hospitalizations
- Visualized geographic clustering with choropleths and computed disparity ratios
- Evaluated multicollinearity using a correlation heatmap

### Modeling Approach

| Method                     | Purpose                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Random Forests**        | Ranked variable importance (flexible, nonparametric) |
| **Negative Binomial Regression** | Estimated effect sizes (IRRs) and compared predictors by race |

Models were stratified into **White** and **People of Color (POC)** populations and adjusted for population size using race-specific offsets.

## Summary of Contributions

- Built a robust, race-stratified model of preventable hospitalizations
- Applied both machine learning and statistical inference for dual insights
- Delivered a public-facing poster and technical report
- Presented results to UnitedHealth Group research advisors and academic mentors

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we propose:

1. **Race-conscious strategies** that address upstream barriers (education, income, employment)
2. Expansion of **Community Health Workers** and **preventive care access** in high-need areas
3. **Integrated care coordination models** for patients at risk of fragmented or overused hospital services
4. **More granular data collection** by race and geography to guide future interventions
